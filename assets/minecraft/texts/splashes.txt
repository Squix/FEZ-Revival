A warp gate!
You are back!
Are you ready to begin your adventure?
Let's go!
You were gone long time!
You have received a gift. A great secret has been revealed to you.
There is a world beyond your village.
There are dimensions beyond the ones you occupy.
I need your help!
This door leads to the outside world.
The door is unsealed!
Hold UP to climb ladders.
Dear Gomez...
Something went wrong.

There is a cube in this village.
Find it, and unseal the door.
Also, pins and t-shirts!
Thank you, Ray Frenden!
